* To tun (inside "tunneling_and_acl" directory):
	sudo make clean
	sudo make run

* To test basic forwarding:
	xterm h1 h2 h3
	./recieve.py (on one of the hosts)
	./send.py 10.0.x.x 'message' (on another host)

* To test basic tunneling:
	xterm h1 h2 h3
	./recieve.py (on one of the hosts)
	./send.py 10.0.x.x 'message' --dst_id x (on another host)

* To test access control:
	xterm h1 h2 h3
	./recieve.py (on one of the hosts)
	./send.py 10.0.x.x 'message' --transport_protocol UDP --port 80
	message should be shown SUCCESSFULLY on host X
	run command: "sudo python3 runtime.py --dst_id 10.0.3.3 --udp_port 80" in another terminal (inside "tunneling_and_acl" directory)
	send again (on xterm): "./send.py 10.0.x.x 'message' --transport_protocol UDP --port 80"
	message sholud NOT be shown since flow table has been updated with new access control entry
