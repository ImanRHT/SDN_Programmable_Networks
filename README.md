# SDN_Programmable_Networks
This repository contain essential networking functionalities—TCP/UDP protocols and ACLs—using the P4 programming language.

##TCP and UDP Implementation

# Overview  

This project consists of two main components:  

## 1. TCP and UDP Implementation  
Develop a P4 program to implement the functionality of the TCP and UDP transport layer protocols on a switch.  

## 2. Access Control List (ACL)  
Create a P4 program to enforce an ACL on a switch, allowing or blocking network traffic based on predefined rules.
