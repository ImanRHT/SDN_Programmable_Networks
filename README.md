# SDN_Programmable_Networks
This repository contain essential networking functionalities—TCP/UDP protocols and ACLs—using the P4 programming language.

## TCP and UDP Implementation

# Overview  

# Getting Started  

## Step 1: Set Up the Environment  

1. **Install VirtualBox**  
   Ensure you have VirtualBox installed on your system.  

2. **Download the Virtual Machine (VM)**  
   Get the pre-configured VM from the INL Lab:  
   - **Username:** `p4`  
   - **Password:** `p4`  

3. **Clone this Repository**  
   Use the following commands to clone the project repository and navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git  
   cd your-repo  
   cd course-net/spring2021-1/assignment2  

4. **Explore Resources**
   Utilize the P4 tutorial and cheatsheet as valuable references throughout the development process.


## 1. TCP and UDP Implementation  
Develop a P4 program to implement the functionality of the TCP and UDP transport layer protocols on a switch.  

## 2. Access Control List (ACL)  
Create a P4 program to enforce an ACL on a switch, allowing or blocking network traffic based on predefined rules.
